# Volt Vision: Automated Electricity Meter Reading System

## Overview

**Volt Vision** is an AI-powered application that automates the process of electricity meter reading using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. By integrating **YOLO V8** (You Only Look Once) for object detection and **OCR** (Optical Character Recognition) for digit recognition, this system can accurately read and interpret electricity meter readings from images. Designed to improve efficiency, accuracy, and transparency, this solution aims to modernize utility management systems, providing significant benefits to both utility providers and consumers.

## Key Features

- **Automated Meter Reading:** Uses YOLO V8 to detect and extract meter digits from images of electricity meters.
- **Fast OCR for Digit Recognition:** Processes images captured under varying lighting conditions, meter types, and angles, ensuring accurate readings.
- **Machine Learning:** Trains models to improve performance and handle small object detection in real-world scenarios.
- **Real-time Processing:** Quickly and accurately processes images for faster meter reading and billing.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Developed with Flutter for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android).

## Problem Statement

Traditional manual electricity meter reading is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. It requires workers to physically visit meters, which can be problematic in densely populated or hard-to-reach areas. Moreover, this process is susceptible to human error and data tampering, leading to inaccurate readings and unfair billing. The Volt Vision project aims to automate this process, improving accuracy, reducing errors, and increasing operational efficiency.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of multiple images of electricity meters captured in various real-world conditions. These images are used to train and evaluate the object detection and OCR models. The data was curated to cover different meter designs, environmental conditions, and lighting variations to ensure robustness and generalization of the system.
